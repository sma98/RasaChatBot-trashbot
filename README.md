###RasaChatBot - TrashBot
Welcome to TrashBot, an innovative chatbot designed to educate and engage children in the proper disposal of waste. TrashBot is an integral part of my final year research project, focusing on creating an interactive and educational experience for children through the implementation of a trash-sorting robot.

Project Overview
TrashBot, powered by RasaChatBot and incorporating Natural Language Processing (NLP), serves as an educational tool to guide children in understanding the significance of responsible waste disposal. The primary goal is to make the learning process enjoyable and interactive.
